1) @Service: 
-This annotation is part of the Spring Framework and is used to indicate that a class is a service bean. 
-It tells Spring to consider it as a service and manage its lifecycle within the Spring container.

2) @Autowired: 
-This annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into the class. 
-In the UserServiceImpl class, private UserRepo userRepo is annotated with @Autowired, which means that an instance of UserRepo will be automatically injected by the Spring container.

3) @AllArgsConstructor: 
-This annotation is from the Lombok library. 
-It generates a constructor with parameters for all class fields. 
-In this case, it is used on the class level, so a constructor with a parameter for UserRepo will be generated. 
-This reduces boilerplate code by eliminating the need to write constructors manually.

4) @Override: 
-This annotation indicates that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method of the superclass. 
-In Java, it is a good practice to use the @Override annotation to ensure that you are actually overriding a method and not accidentally creating a new one.

5) @Repository: 
-The @Repository annotation is used to indicate that a class acts as a data repository, typically for a database. 
-It is often applied to classes implementing Spring Data JPA repositories, but in this case, @Service is used to designate the service layer.

-These annotations help define the structure and behavior of the Spring service implementation (UserServiceImpl). 
-They leverage Spring's features for dependency injection, bean management, and lifecycle control. 
-The Lombok annotation (@AllArgsConstructor) simplifies constructor generation, reducing code verbosity.
