# Layers in spring boot architecture :-


-Spring Boot is a popular framework for building Java-based web applications. 
-Its architecture is designed to be simple and opinionated, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy applications with minimal configuration. 

-The architecture of a typical Spring Boot application includes various layers:

1) Controller Layer:

-Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests.
-Contains annotated classes (usually with '@RestController' or '@Controller' annotations) 
-Define the entry points of the application.
-Processes user input, interacts with the service layer, and returns the appropriate HTTP response.

2) Service Layer:

-Contains the business logic of the application.
-Separates the application's business concerns from the presentation layer.
-Typically annotated with '@Service'.
-Calls to external systems or databases are often handled here.

3) Repository Layer:

-Responsible for data access and persistence.
-Uses Spring Data or other ORM frameworks to interact with databases.
-Annotated with '@Repository'.

4) Model Layer (Entities):

-Represents the data model and entities of the application.
-Annotated with '@Entity' for ORM frameworks like Hibernate.

5)View Layer:

-In the context of Spring Boot, the view layer is often implemented using templates (e.g., Thymeleaf, FreeMarker) or as a RESTful API returning JSON responses.

6) Configuration Layer:

-Handles configuration of the application.
-Uses annotations like '@Configuration', '@Bean', and '@Value' to configure beans and properties.

7) Security Layer:

-Deals with application security.
-Utilizes Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

8) Test Layer:

-Includes test classes for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
-Uses JUnit, TestNG, or other testing frameworks.

9) Aspect Layer:

-Uses aspects to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transactions.
-Annotated with '@Aspect'.

10) Exception Handling Layer:

-Manages exceptions and errors thrown by the application.
-Custom exception handlers can be implemented using '@ControllerAdvice' annotated classes.

-Spring Boot applications often follow the principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with additional layers for handling data access, security, and configuration. 
-However, the exact structure can vary based on the specific requirements and preferences of the development team.
