@SpringBootApplication :-


-It is a meta-annotation that combines three essential annotations:

1) @Configuration: 
-Indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions. 
-In other words, it is a configuration class that defines the application context.

2) @EnableAutoConfiguration: 
-Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. 
-Auto-configuration automatically configures the Spring application based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
-This helps reduce the need for explicit configuration.

3) @ComponentScan: 
-Instructs Spring to scan and discover beans (components, services, controllers, etc.) within the specified package and its sub-packages. 
-It enables Spring to find and register components in the application context.

-By using @SpringBootApplication, you are essentially combining these three annotations into one, making it convenient and concise. 
-It is a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring Boot application with sensible defaults and reduce the amount of boilerplate configuration code.

-Here's a breakdown of how you would achieve the same effect without

	@Configuration
	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.codewithravi.blog")
	public class BlogAppApisApplication {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        SpringApplication.run(BlogAppApisApplication.class, args);
	    }
	}


-Using @SpringBootApplication is equivalent to the above configuration. 
-It promotes convention over configuration and simplifies the setup of a Spring Boot application.
