Que 01. what is Object oriented concept? 
	what is difference between object-based, object-oriented and fully object-oriented language?

Ans:-
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. 
-These objects can encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for a modular and structured approach to software development. 

-The key principles of OOP include:

1) Encapsulation: 
-Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. 
-It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.

2) Inheritance: 
-Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). 
-It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

3) Polymorphism: 
-Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. 
-It enables a single interface to represent different types or forms.
-This concept includes method overriding(Runtime polymorphism) and method Overloading(Compiletime polymorphism).

4) Abstraction: 
-It hides the irrelevant details while exposing the neccessary parts only.
-The process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and ignoring unnecessary details.
-It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

## The differences between object-based, object-oriented, and fully object-oriented languages:

1) Object-Based Programming Language:

-Object-based languages support the concept of objects but may not fully adhere to all principles of OOP.
-These languages may lack features like inheritance or polymorphism, making them less flexible than fully object-oriented languages.
-Ex:- JavaScript and VBScript.

2) Object-Oriented Programming Language:

-Object-oriented languages adhere to the fundamental principles of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
-They provide a structured and modular approach to designing and implementing software.
-Ex:- Java, C++, and Python.

3) Fully Object-Oriented Programming Language:

-Languages that strictly adhere to all aspects of OOP without any compromises.
-Have features which treats everything inside program as objects.
-A fully object-oriented language would ensure that every programming construct.
-It doesn't support primitive datatype(eg.int,char,float,bool,etc)
-While some languages claim to be fully object-oriented, the practicality of such a claim can be debated.

-In summary, object-oriented programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, 
-and the terms "object-based" and "object-oriented" describe the level of adherence to OOP principles in a programming language, 
-with the latter indicating a more comprehensive implementation of these principles. 
-The term "fully object-oriented" is less commonly used and may imply a stricter interpretation of OOP principles.

Que 02. What are advantages of Object Oriented Programming?
	What is Data Security?

Ans:-
# Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1) Modularity: 
-OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating the implementation details within classes. 
-This makes it easier to manage and maintain code.
-Promotes code Reusability.

2) Reusability: 
-OOP allows for the reuse of classes and objects in different parts of a program, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.

3) Flexibility: 
-OOP provides flexibility through polymorphism, allowing the same interface to represent different types or forms.

4) Ease of Maintenance: 
-With encapsulation, changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect other parts of the program, making maintenance easier.

5) Enhanced Code Organization: 
-OOP helps organize code in a more natural and intuitive way, making it easier to understand and work with.

# Data Security :

-Data security in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) involves implementing measures to protect sensitive data within the objects and classes of a program. 
-Here are some key principles and practices related to data security in OOP:

1) Encapsulation:
-It contributes to data security by restricting direct access to the internal state of an object.
-Data members within a class are often declared as private, and access to them is controlled through public methods (getters and setters).


	public class BankAccount 
	{
	   private double balance;	
	   
	   public double getBalance() {
	       	 return balance;
	   }

	   public void deposit(double amount) {
	        // Perform validation and update balance
	        // ...
	   }
	
	   public void withdraw(double amount) {
	        // Perform validation and update balance
	        // ...
	   }
	}


2) Access Control:

-OOP languages like Java provide access control modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public) to regulate the visibility of members (fields and methods) within a class.
-This helps in controlling who can access and modify sensitive data.


	public class Employee {
		private String name;
		protected double salary;
		public String department;
	
	    // ...
	}


3) Inheritance and Polymorphism:	

-While inheritance promotes code reuse, it's essential to consider security implications. 
-Subclasses should carefully extend the behavior of their parent classes without compromising security.
-Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, which can impact data security. 
-Ensure that overridden methods in subclasses maintain the intended security measures.

4) Immutable Objects:

-Immutable objects, whose state cannot be modified after creation, provide a level of data security. 
-Once initialized, their values cannot be changed.
-Use final keyword for fields and avoid providing setters for immutable objects.


	public final class ImmutablePerson {
	    private final String name;
	    private final int age;
	
	    public ImmutablePerson(String name, int age) {
	        this.name = name;
	        this.age = age;
	    }
	
	    public String getName() {
	        return name;
	    }
	
	    public int getAge() {
	        return age;
	    }
	}


5) Secure Coding Practices:

-Follow secure coding practices to avoid vulnerabilities. 
-This includes input validation, avoiding direct user input in queries, and using secure coding libraries.
-Be cautious of potential security pitfalls like SQL injection, buffer overflows, and other common vulnerabilities.
-By incorporating these principles and practices into OOP design, developers can enhance the data security of their applications and mitigate potential risks associated with sensitive information.

# Data Security:

-Data security refers to the protection of data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 
-It involves implementing measures and controls to ensure that data is kept confidential, integrity is maintained, and accessibility is restricted to authorized individuals. 

Key aspects of data security include:

1) Confidentiality: 
-Ensuring that data is accessible only to those who have the proper authorization to view or modify it.

2) Integrity: 
-Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data by preventing unauthorized modifications or alterations.

3) Availability: 
-Ensuring that data is available when needed and that there are measures in place to prevent disruptions or unauthorized denial of access.

4) Authentication: 
-Verifying the identity of users or systems to ensure that only authorized entities have access to sensitive data.

5) Authorization: 
-Granting appropriate permissions and access rights to individuals or systems based on their roles and responsibilities.

6) Encryption: 
-Using encryption techniques to convert sensitive data into a secure format, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.

7) Backup and Recovery: 
-Implementing regular data backups and recovery procedures to protect against data loss or damage.

Data security is crucial in various domains, including business, healthcare, finance, and government, to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the trust of users and stakeholders.

Que 03. What is class and object ? give real life example.

Ans:-

-In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
-It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. 
-An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. 
-It is a tangible entity that represents a real-world concept and can perform actions based on the defined methods.
 
# Real-Life Example:

-Let's consider the concept of a "Car" as a class and a specific car, say a "Toyota Camry," as an object.

# Class - Car:

Attributes (Data Members):
	Maker (e.g., Toyota)
	Model (e.g., Camry)
	Year of Manufacture
	Color
	Engine Capacity
Methods (Functions):
	Start Engine
	Accelerate
	Brake
	Start Music

-The class "Car" serves as a blueprint with defined attributes and methods. 
-It encapsulates the common properties and behaviors that all cars of any make and model may have.

# Object - Toyota Camry:

-An object is an instance of the "Car" class, representing a specific car in the real world.

Attributes (Instance Variables):
	Make: Toyota
	Model: Camry
	Year of Manufacture: 2022
	Color: Silver
	Engine Capacity: 2.5L
Methods (Instance Methods):
	Start Engine
	Accelerate
	Brake
	Start Music

-The Toyota Camry is a tangible, specific car that possesses the characteristics and behaviors defined by the "Car" class. 
-It has its own set of values for the attributes and can perform actions based on the methods defined in the class.


// Class definition
	class Car {
		String make;
		String model;
		int yearOfManufacture;
		String color;
		double engineCapacity;

	    void startEngine() {
	          // Code to start the car's engine
	    }

	    void accelerate() {
        	// Code to accelerate the car
	    }
	
	    void brake() {
	        // Code to apply the car's brakes
	    }
	
	    void startMusic() {
	        // Code to turn on the Music system in car
	    }
	}		
	
// Object instantiation
	Car toyotaCamry = new Car();
	toyotaCamry.make = "Toyota";
	toyotaCamry.model = "Camry";
	toyotaCamry.yearOfManufacture = 2022;
	toyotaCamry.color = "Silver";
	toyotaCamry.engineCapacity = 2.5;
	
	// Using object methods
	toyotaCamry.startEngine();
	toyotaCamry.accelerate();
	toyotaCamry.brake();
	toyotaCamry.startMusic();


-In this example, the class "Car" defines the structure and behavior, 
-and the object "toyotaCamry" is a specific instance of that class with its own set of attribute values.
===================================================================================================================

Que 04. What are characteristics of object? Explain them?

Ans:-

-Objects in object-oriented programming (OOP) have several characteristics that define their behavior and interactions. 
-These characteristics help in organizing and modeling real-world entities in a programming environment. The main characteristics of objects are:

1) Identity:
-Each object has a unique identity, which allows it to be distinguished from other objects. 
-This identity is often represented by a memory address or reference to the object.

2) State:
-The state of an object represents the values of its attributes at a particular point in time. 
-These attributes define the object's characteristics or properties.
-Example: For a "Car" object, the state would include attributes like 
	maker, model, year, and current speed.

3) Behavior:
-Objects can perform actions or exhibit behavior through methods or functions. 
-These methods define the operations that the object can carry out.
-Example: A "Dog" object might have behavior such as barking, fetching, and eating, implemented through methods.

4) Encapsulation:
-Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class. 
-It hides the internal details of the object and exposes only what is necessary.
-Example: In a "BankAccount" class, encapsulation ensures that the account balance can only be accessed or modified through defined methods like deposit and withdraw.

5) Abstraction:
-Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they share. 
-It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.

6) Polymorphism:
-Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
-It enables methods to be applied to objects of various types, providing flexibility and extensibility.
-Example: In a "Shape" hierarchy, polymorphism allows you to call a common method like "calculateArea" on objects of different shapes (e.g., Circle, Square) without knowing their specific types.

7) Inheritance:
-Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). 
-It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy among classes.
-Example: In a "Vehicle" class hierarchy, a "Car" class can inherit common attributes and methods from the more general "Vehicle" class.

These characteristics collectively contribute to the flexibility, modularity, and organization of code in object-oriented programming, making it a powerful paradigm for software development.

==============================================================================================================

Que 05. What is the need of getter and setter functions in class?

Ans:- 

-Getter and setter functions (also known as accessor and mutator methods) in a class are used to access and modify the private attributes of the class. 
-They play a crucial role in achieving encapsulation, which is one of the key principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). 

-Here's why getter and setter functions are needed:

1) Encapsulation:

# Need:
-Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).
-It helps hide the internal details of the object and exposes only what is necessary.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-Getter methods provide controlled access to the private attributes, allowing external code to retrieve their values. Setter methods, on the other hand, enable controlled modification of these attributes.

2) Controlled Access:

# Need: 
-Not all attributes of a class should be directly accessible from outside the class. 
-Some attributes may need to be read-only or write-only, while others may be read-write.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-Getter methods provide read access to the attributes, and setter methods provide write access. 
-By controlling access through methods, the class can enforce constraints or perform additional logic when accessing or modifying attributes.

3) Validation and Logic:

# Need: 
-Sometimes, it's necessary to perform validation or include additional logic when getting or setting attribute values. 
-Direct access to attributes might bypass such logic.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-Getter and setter methods allow the class to incorporate validation checks, constraints, or calculations. 
-For example, a setter method for an age attribute might check that the age is non-negative.

4) Flexibility:

# Need: 
-The internal representation of data within a class may change over time.
-Direct access to attributes would tightly couple external code to the internal implementation.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-Getter and setter methods act as an abstraction layer, providing a stable interface to external code. 
-The internal implementation can change without affecting the external code using the class.

5) Maintaining Consistency:

# Need: 
-Sometimes, modifications to one attribute might require updates or adjustments in related attributes to maintain consistency.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-Setter methods can be used to update related attributes or trigger other actions, ensuring that the class remains in a consistent state.

6) Debugging and Logging:

# Need: 
-During development and debugging, it can be helpful to log or track changes to attribute values.
# Role of Getter and Setter: 
-By encapsulating access through getter and setter methods, you can add logging or debugging statements to monitor when and how attributes are accessed or modified.

-In summary, getter and setter functions are essential for 
.encapsulation
.providing controlled access to the attributes of a class
.enabling validation, maintaining flexibility
.ensuring consistent behavior in response to attribute changes

They contribute to the overall robustness and maintainability of the codebase.

====================================================================================================================

Que 06. What is abstraction and encapsulation ? Give real-life example.

Ans:-

## Abstraction : 
-Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
-that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they share. 
-It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality. 
-Abstraction allows developers to represent the relevant aspects of an object while hiding unnecessary details.

# Real-Life Example:
-Consider the concept of a "Vehicle." 
-In the real world, there are various types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, and airplanes. 
-Abstraction helps in creating a common representation for all these diverse vehicles based on shared characteristics. 
-The essential features might include methods like "start," "accelerate," and "stop," and attributes like "speed" and "fuel level." 
-By abstracting these common features into a "Vehicle" class, you create a generalized blueprint that captures the essential aspects of all vehicles without worrying about the specific details of each type.


// Abstraction through a Vehicle class
	class Vehicle {
	    int speed;
	    int fuelLevel;
	
	    void start() {
	        // Code to start the vehicle
	    }
	
	    void accelerate() {
	        // Code to accelerate the vehicle
	    }
	
	    void stop() {
	        // Code to stop the vehicle
	    }
	}
	
// Concrete implementation for a car
	class Car extends Vehicle {
	    // Additional attributes and methods specific to a car
	    int numberOfDoors;
	    
	    void openTrunk() {
	        // Code to open the car's trunk
	    }
	}
		
// Concrete implementation for a bicycle	
	class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
	    // Additional attributes and methods specific to a bicycle
	    int numberOfWheels;
	
	    void ringBell() {
	        // Code to ring the bicycle's bell
	    }
	}

-In this example, the "Vehicle" class represents the abstraction of common features shared by all vehicles. 
-Concrete classes like "Car" and "Bicycle" inherit from the "Vehicle" class, providing specific details for each type of vehicle.

## Encapsulation :

-Encapsulation is another key OOP concept that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit or class. 
-It helps hide the internal details of the object and exposes only what is necessary. 
-Encapsulation provides a protective barrier and 
-ensures that the object's internal state is accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces.

# Real-Life Example:
-Consider the concept of a "BankAccount." 
-Encapsulation helps in encapsulating the account details and operations within a class, restricting direct access to the account balance and other sensitive information. 
-Getter and setter methods are used to provide controlled access to these attributes, ensuring that changes to the account balance adhere to specific rules or constraints.

// Encapsulation through a BankAccount class
	class BankAccount {
	    private double balance;
	    private String accountHolder;
	
	    public double getBalance() {
	        return balance;
	    }
	    public String getAccountHolder() {
       		return accountHolder;
	    }

	    public void setBalance(double newBalance) {
	        if (newBalance >= 0) {
	            balance = newBalance;	
	        } else {
	            System.out.println("Invalid balance value.");
	        }
	    }
		
	    public void setAccountHolder(String newAccountHolder) {
	        accountHolder = newAccountHolder;
	    }
	
	    public void deposit(double amount) {
	        // Code to handle deposit operation
	    }
	
	    public void withdraw(double amount) {
	        // Code to handle withdrawal operation
	    }
	}


-In this example, the "BankAccount" class encapsulates the private attributes like "balance" and "accountHolder." 
-The encapsulation ensures that external code can only interact with these attributes through the defined getter and setter methods, allowing for controlled access and modification. 
-It helps maintain the integrity of the bank account and provides a clear interface for interacting with the object.

============================================================================================================================

Que 07. What is polymorphism ? What is its types ? Explain them with examples.

Ans :-

# Polymorphism:
-Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
-It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. 
-It enables a single interface to represent various types of objects, promoting flexibility and extensibility in the code.

Types of Polymorphism:

1) Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading):

-Occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (type or number of parameters).


	public class Calculator {
	    // Method Overloading
	    public int add(int a, int b) {
	        return a + b;
	    }
	
	    public double add(double a, double b) {
	        return a + b;
	    }
	}

-In this example, the add method is overloaded with different parameter types (int and double).

2) Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding):

-Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
-The method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass.

// Superclass
	class Animal {
	    public void sound() {
	        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
	    }
	}
	
// Subclass
	class Dog extends Animal {
	    // Method Overriding
	    public void sound() {
	        System.out.println("Dog barks");
	    }
	}

	public class PolymorphismExample {
 	   public static void main(String[] args) {
	        Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
	        animal.sound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog
	    }
	}

-In this example, Dog extends Animal and overrides the sound method. 
-During runtime, the sound method of the Dog class is invoked.

3) Parametric Polymorphism (Generics):

-Involves writing code that can work with a variety of data types without specifying them beforehand. 
-Generics enable the creation of classes, methods, or interfaces that can operate on different types.


// Generic class
	class Box<T> {
	    private T content;
	
	    public void setContent(T content) {
	        this.content = content;
	    }
	
	    public T getContent() {
	        return content;
	    }
	}
	
	public class GenericsExample {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
	        Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
	
	        integerBox.setContent(42);
	        stringBox.setContent("Hello, Generics!");
	
	        System.out.println("Integer Box Content: " + integerBox.getContent());
	        System.out.println("String Box Content: " + stringBox.getContent());
	    }
	}


-In this example, the Box class is generic, allowing it to hold different types of content without code duplication.

-Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, reusability, and readability 
by allowing different implementations to be used interchangeably 
based on their common interface or shared behavior.
================================================================================================================

Que 08. What is method overloading ? Which are the rules of method overloading ?

Ans :-

# Method Overloading :
-Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming 
-It allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same scope (class or interface). 
-The methods must be in the same class and have unique parameter signatures, which may include a different number or type of parameters.

# Rules of Method Overloading:

1) Parameter List:
-Methods must have a different parameter list. 
-This can involve a difference in the number or types of parameters.

	public class Example {
	    // Method Overloading
	    public void doSomething(int x) {
	        // Code
	    }

	    public void doSomething(int x, int y) {
	        // Code
	    }
	}

2) Parameter Types:
-The types of parameters must differ in order to distinguish between the overloaded methods.

	public class Example {
	    // Method Overloading
	    public void printInfo(String name) {
	        // Code
	    }
	
	    public void printInfo(int age) {
	        // Code
	    }
	}

3) Parameter Order:
-The order of parameters should be different to avoid ambiguity.

	public class Example {
	    // Method Overloading
	    public void displayInfo(int age, String name) {
	        // Code
	    }
	
	    public void displayInfo(String name, int age) {
	        // Code
	    }
	}

4) Return Type: 
-The return type is not considered when overloading methods. 
-Methods with the same name and parameter list (types and order) but different return types will result in a compilation error.

	public class Example {
	    // Compilation error: Conflicting return type
	    public int calculate(int x, int y) {
	        // Code
	    }
	
	    // Compilation error: Conflicting return type
	    public double calculate(int x, int y) {
	        // Code
	    }
	}

# Why Return Type is Not Considered in Method Overloading:

-During method overloading the method's signature is determined by its name and parameter list. 
-Overloading is all about providing multiple methods with the same name but different ways of accepting and processing input. 
-The return type alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify a method, as multiple methods can have the same return type.

-Consideration of return type in method overloading would lead to ambiguity, and it would complicate the method resolution process. 
-Overloaded methods must be easily distinguishable based on the provided arguments. Since the return type is not part of the method's signature, it does not contribute to the distinction between overloaded methods.

-In summary, method overloading focuses on the name and parameters of methods, 
-The return type is excluded from consideration to simplify the language rules and avoid potential conflicts.

========================================================================================================================

Que 09. What are different types of hierarchy ?
	When to use which one ?

Ans :-
